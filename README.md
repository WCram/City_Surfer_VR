Synopsis:\
Created a prototype for a locamotion system that would propel the user indrectly using non friction (ice) panels or slides and let the player flying around a city. 

Purpose:\
Allow the player to navigate around a city as if on a self generated ice slide\
No direct user input on control, only on panel \ slide pitch and yaw\
Be able to control momentum by tilting the slide forward or backward\
Use Unity Physics materials to remove friction from slide object\
