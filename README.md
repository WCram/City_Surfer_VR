# City_Surfer_VR

Synopsis:\
Created a prototype for a locomotion system that would propel the user indirectly using non friction (ice) panels or slides and let the player flying around a city.

Purpose:\
Allow the player to navigate around a city as if on a self generated ice slide\
No direct user input on control, only on panel \ slide pitch and yaw\
Be able to control momentum by tilting the slide forward or backward\
Use Unity Physics materials to remove friction from slide object

WIP:\
VR Integration in early implementation. Player does not turn with the rotation of slide, leads to drifiting and heavy motion sickness.
